I am **_Scott Ni_** from Villa Elisa, Paraguay. I am majoring in Computer Science Engineering at
[FP-UNA](http://www.pol.una.py).

I am interested in web development and open source technologies; therefore, I am constantly trying
to learn new stuff related to HTML5, JavaScript, CSS and more.

In my blog I write about web development and anything related to computer science.
